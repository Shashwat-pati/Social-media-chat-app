ðŸ”¸Used `MySQL` for database management purpose and also created REST API using `Insomnia`.
ðŸ”¸In this project i learnt about `React Query` and how it simplifies data fetching, caching, and state management, reducing boilerplate code, improving readability, and offering a more intuitive solution compared to `React Redux`.
